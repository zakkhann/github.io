<h1>Margin & Padding</h1>
<h2>
  What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
  <em>
    In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is
    the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another
    way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the
    padding property controls the space inside an element.

<h3>
  Margin, border, and padding are fundamental concepts in CSS that define the
  layout and spacing of elements. They are part of the box model, which is a
  fundamental structure in CSS that represents how elements are laid out in
  terms of content, padding, border, and margin. Here's a brief explanation of
  each: Margin: The margin is the space outside an element's border. It clears
  an area outside the border and does not have any background color. It is used
  to create space between elements. It doesn't influence the size or layout of
  the element itself but affects the positioning of the element in relation to
  other elements.

<h4>
  Border: The border is the actual boundary of the element. It is placed between
  the padding and the margin. It has properties like color, style, and width
  that can be specified. It directly influences the dimensions of the element.

  Padding: The padding is the space between the content of the element and its
  border. It clears an area around the content inside the element. It affects
  the element's size by increasing the space between the content and the border.
