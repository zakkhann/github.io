  <h2>
    Self-Identity and Values:
    <em>
      I think believing in yourself is a big hurdle and loving yourself. That's
      really how you find confidence in yourself and push yourself to the
      limits. Personally having a broken family and being around tall poppy
      syndrome led me to many insecurities and not motivating myself enough to
      accomplish anything. Growing up I had to bounce between different families
      and court so when I came to an age of maturing and realising I knew that I
      had to become someone and do it myself so nobody can turn around one day
      to you and say "see, I got you there". Im muslim so Islam has kept me
      disciplined about my goals in life and how I should be as a person and
      treat others as well. One day I want to be so successful in terms of
      financial of course but mostly a person of good attitude and perosnality,
      to wins peoples hearts and their opinions. I guess we all gotta start
      somewhere right ..

    A mature understanding of oneself and one's emotions implicitly includes
    some understanding of one's values. Thus, as youths' self-identities evolve,
    a value system emerges. However, some adolescents do not seek to actively
    explore their own individual value system; instead, they simply accept the
    values of their family, community, and culture. But the majority of youth
    will explore their value system, at least to some degree. This exploratory
    process may range from a simple questioning of why things are the way they
    are, to experimentation with a different set of values and beliefs, to
    outright rejection of generally accepted values and beliefs. This
    exploratory process can be frustrating for many parents, especially when
    teens challenge the religious or cultural values held sacred by the family,
    or when youth directly challenge parental authority.
