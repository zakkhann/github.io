      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>
        My learning plan focuses on mastering both front-end and back-end
        development. I'll begin by mastering the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward, I'll delve into popular front-end frameworks such as
        React or Vue.js, exploring how to develop dynamic and interactive user
        interfaces for modern web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, I'll immerse myself in server-side programming, learning
        about data handling, API development, and authentication methods using
        technologies like Django with Python or Node.js with Express.
      </p>
      <p>
        To complement my skills, I'll gain proficiency in database management,
        encompassing both relational and NoSQL databases, as well as SQL queries
        for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I'll familiarize myself with essential software
        development practices, including testing methodologies, version control
        systems like Git, and deployment strategies to ensure smooth and
        efficient project delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through continuous learning, personal projects, and collaborative
        endeavors, my ultimate goal is to enhance my capabilities, stay abreast
        of industry trends, and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving
        field of web development.
