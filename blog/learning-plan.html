      The main goal of my learning plan is to acquire thorough knowledge of both
      front-end and back-end development. I'll start with the basics and study
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make visually appealing and well-structured
      webpages. Using well-known front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js as a
      foundation, I will investigate how to develop dynamic and interactive user
      interfaces. In parallel, I'll learn server-side programming, handling
      data, building APIs, and implementing authentication with either Django
      with Python or Node.js with Express. Additionally, I'll learn about
      databases, including relational and NoSQL databases as well as SQL. I'll
      also become acquainted with testing procedures, version control systems
      like Git, and deployment strategies. By means of ongoing education, side
      initiatives, and teamwork, my objective is to improve my abilities, remain
      current with market developments,
