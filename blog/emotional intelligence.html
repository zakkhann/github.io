      <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize,
        understand, manage, and effectively use one's own emotions and those of
        others. It involves a set of skills that allow individuals to navigate
        social complexities, make informed decisions, and build positive
        relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of emotional intelligence gained prominence through the work
        of psychologists Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer, and later popularized
        by author and science journalist Daniel Goleman. Emotional Intelligence
        is often broken down into several key components:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> The ability to recognize and
          understand one's own emotions, including their impact on thoughts and
          behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-regulation:</strong> The capacity to manage and control
          one's emotions, impulses, and reactions. This involves staying calm
          under pressure, adapting to change, and handling stress effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Motivation:</strong> The drive to pursue goals with energy and
          persistence, even in the face of challenges. Motivated individuals are
          typically able to delay gratification for long-term success.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empathy:</strong> The skill of understanding and sharing the
          feelings of others. It involves being able to "put yourself in someone
          else's shoes" and recognize their perspectives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social skills:</strong> The ability to navigate social
          situations, build and maintain relationships, and communicate
          effectively. This includes conflict resolution, collaboration, and
          effective teamwork.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>IQ (Intelligence Quotient):</strong> IQ measures cognitive
        intelligence, focusing on abilities such as logical reasoning,
        problem-solving, abstract thinking, and memory. It is often assessed
        through standardized tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>EQ (Emotional Quotient):</strong> EQ measures emotional
        intelligence, which involves the ability to recognize, understand,
        manage, and effectively use one's own emotions, as well as the ability
        to understand and influence the emotions of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Components:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>IQ:</strong> Primarily assesses cognitive abilities, such as
        mathematical reasoning, language skills, and spatial awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>EQ:</strong> Focuses on emotional awareness, empathy,
        interpersonal skills, communication, and the ability to navigate social
        situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, while IQ focuses on cognitive abilities and intellectual
        skills, EQ centers on emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills.
        Both are valuable in different aspects of life, and a well-rounded
        individual often possesses a balance of both IQ and EQ.
