      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Time management, preparing myself mentally, how patient I am with
        problem solving
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In programming, values guide us to write code that aligns with ethical
        standards and respects the rights and well-being of others, in
        programming, empathy helps us see things from the perspective of our
        users, understanding their needs, frustrations, and preferences,In
        programming, self-awareness helps us recognize our limitations, biases,
        and areas for improvement.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Majority of everything really, i can't really explain but has improved
        socialising better and human skills understanding
      </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I think self-reflection has alot to do with it and changing mindsets
        while adjusting to balancing technical and personal development, which
        includes time and commitment for sure.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I reckon it is needed and as in the handbook it has said before that
        tech industries are not looking for the best coders but better humans
        who can socialise and change their culture in the working industry. So
        having human skills is very important in and out the industry.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        personally i think its great and not a waste of time because even if you
        know so much coding, you will be shy in terms of you can't socialise and
        can't explain or talk or present a project or idea etc because there is
        no human skills in you, you need this to create bonds with people and
        change their perspective on how they think about you.
