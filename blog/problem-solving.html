      <h1>What was the problem?</h1>
      <p>
        For me personally just understanding the whole overall concept and
        running npm test, it was very new to me and i was worried. I am a visual
        learner so the workshop video really helped throughout.
      </p>
      <h2>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> myself believe it or not but even i
          was surprised that i fixed minor errors by myself even though they
          weren't big errors. I guess thats the process of learning though
          right.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discord/Facilitators:</strong> Obviously when you're lost and
          have no idea what to do, the facilitators always come to the rescue
          and even some class mates through the discord channel, which helps in
          pair progamming or bond friendships.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI applications:</strong> apps like chat GPT have helped me
          understand the structure of the code and i ask it to guide me step by
          step on what it means and it really comes in handy so i can always go
          back to that conversation and understand it for example "for loops",
          "if else statments" etc. functions or elements that i forget.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Handbook</strong> The dev-academy handbook has actually helped
          me memorise some functions and instructions that i forgot or got lost
          at. the javascript glossary in the handbook has helped me a ton.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Youtube:</strong> Being a visual learner youtube is something
          i can't go wrong with and nothing helps more than visually seeing the
          problem you are stuck at and the dev-academy workshop videos have
          helped me alot.

      <h2>Solving a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript Kata:</strong> Solving a problem is so satisfying and when you understand the step by step concept of how you solved it makes it ten times better. soon as i started the kata challenge i was stuck on the spouse key question and i had a look on youtube and the handbook glossary that "how do i fit this code in? does it have to be in curly brackets? where do i fit this?" and i came across and realised not too late that it's an individual code and does not need to be in a string or brackets. pretty beginner when i realised it. I felt worried and overwhelmed during the challenge because i had that idea of failing and being stuck. I learnt that you always have sources or people to go to when your stuck and they can break it down and explain it in terms that are so easy to comprehend.

      <h2>Reflect on using these methods/techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> It was new because it's like talking to yourself just before you code or after depends when you want to write it but its probably one of the methods i could gain over confident on because it makes the code look neater and im not used to it yet so haven't included it that much but i see the difference and when you explain it in sections it looks alot simplier to comprehend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trying something:</strong> I see with trying soemthing im not too confident on and i can get lost as i easily forget things so not my strong point but fiddling and trying new things in your code and CSS is really cool because you can design some really ways.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong>This process of verbalizing their thinking helps individuals organize and structure their thoughts more clearly. I got that definiton of google and one of the methods coming up next ill explain is googling so as you can see that assists me too and i agree with the definiton of google giving me about the rubber ducky method, as you explain step by step it becomes more clear to your answer in its literal sense and helps with alot of debugging code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Being honest I was lost and had no idea what it was saying error wise and after the help of the workshop video i understood where in the terminal or the DOM it breaks down the problem and what i should be reading thats my error because all i saw was red, understanding it bit by bit after trial and error it made sense and now when i get a error message i know what to fix and if it doesn't give a clear hint i ask AI or the discord channel.
        </li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>console.logging:</strong> I have learnt this in the past before i was doing dev academy and it has helped alot obviously needing it to output your answer but im still a beginner and learning so i do get stuck sometimes where i have to fit what im actually console logging. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Googling:</strong> Probably the most confident i am about this as its simple and i think majority of people know how to do this. Asking google about definitons or concepts is really helpful example; "import and exporting files" really helped me understand step by step.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> Everytime I have asked peers for help in the discord they have come through and explained and helped me with my issues, they are good at what they do and WANT students to ask them for help. sometimes for extra sources or references they drop links to the problem you are stuck on to help you further understand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving process with reflection:</strong> Don't have much to say about this but after every commited work i go back and reflect and try understand how i progressed through the challenge/assignment so i keep that in mind and try understand concepts and elements for future work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help:</strong> For me it's when im absoulutely stuck on something, could be a challenge or the terminal etc. Facilitators have assisted me and also in a video call where i have shared my screen and they helped me step by step to understand and resolve my problems. What made me so reluctant to ask for help was I don't want to seem annoying and constanly post up questions that im stuck on. I seem dumb and it feels like im not trying to resolve it on my own so i struggle with that thought. After seeing that the facilitators want you to ask questions and want alot of them so what i will do differently is now ask and be comfortable with asking so i can understand and resolve my errors quicker.
